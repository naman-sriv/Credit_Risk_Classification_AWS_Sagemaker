## Overview

**Credit Risk Classification using AWS SageMaker** is an end-to-end project that demonstrates how to build, train, and deploy a machine learning model to classify credit risk (e.g., predicting if a loan applicant is likely to default), utilizing AWS SageMaker’s managed ML services. The project covers data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and deployment in a scalable and reproducible way.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, feature engineering, and transformation scripts.
- **Model Training**: Training pipelines using AWS SageMaker SDK.
- **Model Evaluation**: Metrics and visualization for evaluating model performance.
- **Deployment**: Scripts and steps for deploying models as SageMaker endpoints.
- **Automation**: Sample workflow for automating training and deployment.
- **Scalability**: Easily adaptable to larger datasets and more complex models.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/naman-sriv/Credit_Risk_Classification_AWS_Sagemaker.git
    cd Credit_Risk_Classification_AWS_Sagemaker
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **(Optional) Set up AWS credentials**
    - Configure your AWS CLI with `aws configure`, or set environment variables as per [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html).

## Usage

### 1. Explore the Notebooks

- Check the `notebooks/` directory for EDA, training, and deployment walkthroughs.
- Example: `notebooks/eda.ipynb`, `notebooks/train_model.ipynb`, `notebooks/deploy_model.ipynb`

### 2. Prepare Data

- Place your raw dataset in the `data/` folder or update paths in the config files.
- Run data preprocessing scripts:
    ```bash
    python src/preprocessing.py --config config/preprocessing.yaml
    ```

### 3. Train the Model

- Local training:
    ```bash
    python src/train.py --config config/train_config.yaml
    ```
- Or use SageMaker:
    - Follow instructions in `notebooks/train_model.ipynb` to launch a SageMaker training job.

### 4. Evaluate the Model

- Use evaluation scripts or notebooks to review metrics and visualizations.

### 5. Deploy the Model

- Deploy using SageMaker endpoint scripts or via notebook.
- Example:
    ```bash
    python src/deploy.py --model-path <model_artifact>
    ```

## Model Training & Evaluation

- **Algorithms Used**: (e.g., Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest)
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, etc.
- **Validation**: k-fold cross-validation, hold-out set, etc.

---

## Deployment

- **SageMaker Endpoint**: Deploy trained model as a REST API endpoint.
- **Sample Request**:
    ```python
    import boto3

    runtime = boto3.client('sagemaker-runtime')
    response = runtime.invoke_endpoint(
        EndpointName='your-endpoint-name',
        ContentType='text/csv',
        Body='<CSV_DATA>'
    )
    print(response['Body'].read())
    ```

---

## Customization

- Change hyperparameters in the `config/` directory.
- Add new features or models in `src/`.
- Update data sources as needed.
